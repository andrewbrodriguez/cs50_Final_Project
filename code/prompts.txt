1A charming scene unfolds in a cozy woodland house where three bears, each varying in size, reside. Outside, the porridge cools as they venture into the forest. Meanwhile, a young girl named Goldilocks, adorned with cascading golden curls, stumbles upon their dwelling. Her mischievous exploration leads her to the bears' table, where she attempts each bowl of porridgeâ€”discovering the great bear's to be scorching, the middle bear's to be frigid, and the little bear's to be perfectly tempered. Her satisfaction compels her to devour the contents of the small bowl. Curiosity piques her interest, and she ascends to the bedroom. Experimenting with each bed, she first reclines on the spacious sleeping quarters of the great bear, then the middle-sized bear's bed, until she finally embraces the snugness of the little bear's resting place, finding it to be the perfect fit.

2A sense of intrigue builds as the bears return home to find their porridge disturbed. The great, huge bear's booming voice echoes through the house, expressing his displeasure at the intrusion. The middle bear joins in, expressing a similar sentiment. However, it is the little, small wee bear who makes the discovery of the missing porridge, spotting the spoon nestled in the empty pot. With an innocent voice, the little bear shares the unsettling news. A shiver of alarm courses through the bears as they ascend the staircase to their bedroom. The revelation brings forth a collective exclamation of surprise, as the great bear loudly declares that someone has been resting in his bed.
