1Create a gentle and warm painting of three bears, each with their unique size, living harmoniously in a cozy woodland home, as they venture out into the peaceful forest with a pot of cooling porridge.

2Illustrate a delightful scene where a charming little girl with golden cascading curls, affectionately known as Goldilocks, enters the bears' house with a sense of curiosity and innocence.

3Capture the moment as Goldilocks, with her enchanting curls, samples the steaming porridge of the great, huge bear, finding it too hot, then tries the chilled porridge of the middle bear, finding it too cold, and finally discovers the perfectly balanced porridge of the little, small wee bear.

4Depict the endearing moment when Goldilocks, having found the porridge that was just right, relishes its taste and consumes it with delight. Then, show her exploring the beds of the great, huge bear, the middle bear, and lastly the little, small wee bear, before finding the most fitting bed where she peacefully covers herself, quickly drifting into a tranquil slumber.

5Capture the moment as the three bears return home, their anticipation growing, only to discover that someone has tampered with their porridge; depict the great, huge bear expressing his surprise, with a resonant voice, exclaiming, "Somebody has been at my porridge!" with a mix of astonishment and amusement.

6Illustrate the middle bear joining in, expressing his realization that someone has indeed tasted his porridge, using his middle voice. Then show the little, small wee bear inspecting his own bowl, only to discover an empty pot with a spoon resting inside, signaling that the porridge has been completely devoured.

7Paint the scene of the little, small wee bear, with his soft voice, expressing his astonishment at the disappearance of his porridge. Then depict the three bears, with curiosity piqued, making their way upstairs to their cozy bedroom.

8Illustrate the moment when the great, huge bear, with a deep and rough voice, exclaims in surprise, "Somebody has been lying in my bed!" Then portray the bears' increasing realization of intrusion as they discover that someone has indeed been occupying their beds.

9Conjure the image of the middle bear, using his moderate voice, expressing his astonishment at finding someone in his bed. Next, portray the little, small, wee bear discovering upon his pillow a captivating sightâ€”a radiant pool of golden curls and the serene, slumbering face of a little girl, nestled there comfortably. Show the bear eagerly pointing out the presence of the intruder, exclaiming, "Somebody has been lying in my bed, and here she is!"

10Picture the little, small wee bear, with his soft and gentle voice, acknowledging the discovery of Goldilocks in his bed. Then visualize the swift reaction of Goldilocks, as she swiftly leaps off the bed, darts downstairs, rushes out the door, and hastens along the garden path. Show her running with vigor until she eventually arrives at her grandma's house, depicting a cozy and welcoming home.
